# Substance Forms

Substance Forms is a JavaScript library you can include your page to create
better web forms. You can mark areas of the page as editable and access
the contents with a simple JavaScript API. You have full control over markup
and styling, and you can mix the rich text inputs with classic form elements.

See [the demo](http://substance.io/forms).

Project Status: Experimental
